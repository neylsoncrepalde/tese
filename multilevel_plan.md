## What do MUSICIANS do?

Musicians <span style="font-size: 150%">play</span>. In order to play, they need <span style="font-size: 150%">other musicians</span>. Also, musicians need <span style="font-size: 150%">advisement and feedback</span> before they play a solo or a chamber music concert. This person can be a teacher or a friend. Sometimes, musicians need <span style="font-size: 150%">scores</span> to study and prepare if they are very expensive.


- first network: **Whom did/do you play with?**

- second network: **Who did/do you ask for feedback on your playing?**

- third network: **To whom did you ask for a music score?**


## What do ORCHESTRAS do?

Orchestras <span style="font-size: 150%">play concerts</span>. In order to play their concerts, they need <span style="font-size: 150%">budget</span> to pay the bills. Also, they need a <span style="font-size: 150%">place</span> to play, a venue. Once they have a venue, they need <span style="font-size: 150%">public</span> and the public only come to the concerts if they <span style="font-size: 150%">get aware</span> of them. Sometimes, when scores and orchestra material are too expensive, they can borrow <span style="font-size: 150%">scores</span> from other orchestras. Orchestras can invite <span style="font-size: 150%">guest musicians</span> to work with them, either conductors, invited soloists or even whole choruses if they have a chorus work like Beethoven's 9th. 

- first network: **Who invest on the orchestra? Where do you get money from?** (People and institutions)

- second network: **Where have you performed at?** (Institutions only)

- third network: **Who does the advertisement of the concerts?** (Institutions only)

- fourth network: **To whom did you ask for scores and orchestra materials?** (Institutions only)

- fifth network: **Who did you invite to be a guest?** (People and institutions)
