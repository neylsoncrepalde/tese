<h1>Multilevel Plan</h1>

<h3>Neylson Crepalde</h3>

<h2>What do MUSICIANS do?</h2>

<p>Musicians <span style="font-size: 150%">play</span>. In order to play, they need <span style="font-size: 150%">other musicians</span>. Also, musicians need <span style="font-size: 150%">advisement and feedback</span> before they play a solo or a chamber music concert. This person can be a teacher or a friend. Sometimes, musicians need <span style="font-size: 150%">scores</span> to study and prepare if they are very expensive.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>first network: <strong>Whom did/do you play with?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>second network: <strong>Who did/do you ask for feedback on your playing?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>third network: <strong>To whom did you ask for a music score?</strong></p></li>
</ul>


<h2>What do ORCHESTRAS do?</h2>

<p>Orchestras <span style="font-size: 150%">play concerts</span>. In order to play their concerts, they need <span style="font-size: 150%">budget</span> to pay the bills. Also, they need a <span style="font-size: 150%">place</span> to play, a venue. Once they have a venue, they need <span style="font-size: 150%">public</span> and the public only come to the concerts if they <span style="font-size: 150%">get aware</span> of them. Sometimes, when scores and orchestra material are too expensive, they can borrow <span style="font-size: 150%">scores</span> from other orchestras. Orchestras can invite <span style="font-size: 150%">guest musicians</span> to work with them, either conductors, invited soloists or even whole choruses if they have a chorus work like Beethoven&rsquo;s 9th.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>first network: <strong>Who invest on the orchestra? Where do you get money from?</strong> (People and institutions)</p></li>
<li><p>second network: <strong>Where have you performed at?</strong> (Institutions only)</p></li>
<li><p>third network: <strong>Who does the advertisement of the concerts?</strong> (Institutions only)</p></li>
<li><p>fourth network: <strong>To whom did you ask for scores and orchestra materials?</strong> (Institutions only)</p></li>
<li><p>fifth network: <strong>Who did you invite to be a guest?</strong> (People and institutions)</p></li>
</ul>
